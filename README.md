IEEE_certificate
================

Our group (ISEPinIEEE is and IEEE Student Branch) had a very specific problem. How we had to fill many certificates, we decided to utilize the functionality of Pythom to generate certificates automatically. To simplify the sending of certificates, we create an SMTP client that sends e-mails containing a link to our server. 

This solution is very specific, but we think the code is well commented and ready to be used by the entire community that has this "problem". 

The authors of this program are: Victor Fernandes (PDF generation using fpdf library) and Pedro Sousa (SMTP client)
